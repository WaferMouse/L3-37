# L3-37 for EDMC
Multi tool plugin for Elite: Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC)

# Features
- Surface navigation view to get a bearing for a given latitude and longitude in real time.
- Neutron navigation view for following routes generated from [spansh.co.uk/plotter](https://www.spansh.co.uk/plotter).  When you reach a waypoint, it copies the name of the next waypoint to the clipboard.  You can also right-click system names to copy them to the clipboard.  It also estimates fuel use.
- Fleet view which lets you find your ships easily.  You can right-click to copy the location to clipboard, click on the ship name to view the ship in EDSM, and click anywhere else to view the location system on EDSM.
- Chat view that outputs message, timestamp, sender and the channel used.  Supports copying to the clipboard (use Ctrl-X - NOT Ctrl-C).  Outputs the system name when you start a hyperspace jump, with a link to EDSM and a right-click menu to copy to the clipboard.  "Freeze" button to stop the chat from dropping to the bottom when a new message arrives, useful for if you're scrolling back whilst people are still talking.
